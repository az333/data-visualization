## Significance:

Gun violence is a major current issue in the US.

## Explanation of Data Visualization:

We will have a map of the US with a color range that shows firearm deaths per population size. We will also have bar graphs showing how other causes of death compare to gun violence for each state.

## User Interaction:

The user can click on states to get the stats for all leading causes of death, and choose 2 states to see a side by side comparison.

## Effects:

The user can explore the question of how significant gun violence is in the US, and how different states compare in terms of safety.

## D3 Utilization:

We will use D3 to generate the colored map of the US and bar graphs, and animate how much bar graphs change from state to state.
