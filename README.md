## Significance:

Gun violence is a major current issue in the US.

## Explanation of Data Visualization:

We will have a map of the US and each state will be a different shade of blue depending on the firearm deaths proportional to its population size. Under the US map, users will have an option to select two states to compare leading causes of deaths. This will redirect the user to another page which shows a double bar graph about the leading causes of death for a side-by-side comparison of those two states.

## User Interaction:

The user can click on states to get the stats for all leading causes of death, and choose 2 states to see a side by side comparison.

## Effects:

The user can explore the question of how significant gun violence is in the US, and how different states compare in terms of safety.

## D3 Utilization:

We will use D3 to generate the colored map of the US and bar graphs, and animate how much bar graphs change from state to state.
